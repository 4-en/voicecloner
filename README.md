# Real-time voice cloning

Goal: Convert speech audio from person A into speech audio for person B using an embedding of person B's voice. This conversion should be done in real-time and if possible on low-end hardware or CPU only.

We will train the model using unlabeled data, i.e. we will not require aligned pairs of audio from person A and person B.
